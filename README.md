## Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address? 

the main purpose of this application is that it's an inventory tracker application, it is designed to let the user log in to a secure Application at the login screen they will enter their e-mail or user ID and the password which will be hidden. Upon successful user authentication they will be taken to a grid style view of the inventory, or they will be able to add, delete, increase, or edit an inventory entry. The application will also have a settings page as well as a notification page which can be combined into one.

## What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful??

The main screens of this application as stated above are the login screen, a main inventory grid like view screen that displays the inventory, as well as a setting /notification page. The theme of the application was intended to be basic and straightforward as not to distract the end user. This was accomplished by using subdued colors for the backgrounds and font.

## How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

I was a little overambitious when first approaching the design of this application I was quickly overwhelmed by all the features that needed to be implemented. I quickly scrapped what I had and restarted with an outlined list of goals that I needed to accomplish at each stage of the application and its development, this kept me focused and on track for success. One thing I like to do when programming an application is to make sure whatever I'm working on currently is functioning before I move on to the next thing, that way nothing ever gets forgotten about.

## How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

One method of testing the application's functionality that I used was to run a debugger and check the functionality of whatever I was working on before moving on to the next process our task I need to accomplish. I also freguently checked the result to see what the application would look like live on the device.

## Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

One area of this application that I needed to adapt to overcome short comings would be the implementation of the text feature, for some reason I found this really difficult, possibly could be because of having to coordinate so many different resources to work in tandem with one another, but I didn’t even know where to start here as I didn’t know how to accomplish this.

## In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

One aspect of this project that I thought I implemented well was the login feature and page, this asked the user for their info and password then authenticated it by retrieving the credentials from an outside database or structure, if the user did not have an account, they were given the option to create one or they were logged in and taken to the main inventory page.
